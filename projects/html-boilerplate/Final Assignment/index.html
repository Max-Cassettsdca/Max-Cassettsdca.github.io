        <p>
            California is known for Hollywood, In-and-out, the Golden Gate bridge. People move to the state for its
            beautiful weather and rich culture. You would be hard pressed to find any imperfection at a first glance at
            the Golden State, but let's look a little deeper. In 2023 it was reported that since 2018 millions have
            flocked from the California coast to other American states. Other studies including census done by the IRS
            have come to the same conclusion, people leaving the state droves. But why?

            California has a problem with money. That's a broad statement but at its essence that's what it is.
            California has one of the most expensive housing markets, food prices, and transportation prices in the
            continental United states? Well why, one might say? Because of course it would, you would hear my shout from
            afar. It is the most populous state in the Union with dense yet large cities that have attracted people with
            its natural scenery and large job market. Throughout the last century people have moved to California en
            masse and now it's crowded and there is only so much to go around. The demand drives the price up massive
            percentage points which has created a huge divide between the upper, middle, and lower echelons of society.
            KTLA ( a Los Angeles news station) quoted “Michael A. Stoll, economist and professor in the Department of
            Public Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles” saying “As housing costs continue to rise,
            Americans are moving to lower-density, more affordable regions between expensive, economic-driving states.”
            This has created a problem in and of itself, made worse by politics.

                    People are often quick to label California as an inherently Blue state on the political spectrum but
                    that my
                    friend, is a generalization. There is a significant republican population in California exemplified
                    by the
                    last election for governor and president. Republicans are making moves in California no doubt but
                    they are
                    also literally moving. There is significant data presented by the IRS that indicates that
                    Califonrians are
                    moving to traditionally red states including Texas and Florida. Texas and Florida are considered
                    more
                    business friendly and have softer taxes and cheaper gas when compared to California, while keeping
                    the warm
                    weather and scenic views.

                    Another key driver of people away from California is the widespread homeless situation in her
                    cities. California ranks number one in homelessness overall in the United States. In the cities the
                    homeless are rampant and apparent, especially in the coastal cities of San Francisco, San Diego, and
                    Los Angeles. The local governments have not allocated enough to local homeless shelters and policing
                    to fix the situation so it is currently a situation that the residents have to live with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The California government is in fact taking steps to mitigate the damage that's been done to its
                    population numbers, but the question is begged, will it be enough? Reforms in homelessness and
                    fixing the economy might go far for those who choose to bear it but time will only tell whether or
                    not the population will reach its former numbers.
