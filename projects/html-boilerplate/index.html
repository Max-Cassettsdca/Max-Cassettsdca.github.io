    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        Cook the Steak: Season both sides of the steak with salt, pepper, and Montreal steak seasoning. Heat a skillet
        over medium-high heat and cook to your desired doneness (about 3-5 minutes per side for medium-rare). Let it
        rest while you prepare the rest.
        <br>
        Cook the Eggs: In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium, add a bit of oil or butter, and crack in the eggs.
        Cook sunny-side up, over-easy, or scrambled, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
        <br>
        Heat the Refried Beans: In a small pan, warm the refried beans over low heat, stirring occasionally until heated
        through. Add a pinch of salt if needed.
        <br>
        Serve: Plate the steak, eggs, and beans together. Optionally, garnish with fresh herbs or hot sauce. Enjoy!
