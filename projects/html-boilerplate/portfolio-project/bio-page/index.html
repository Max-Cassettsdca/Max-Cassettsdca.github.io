Where I'm From
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>
I’m from a little old town tucked in between Los Angeles and San Diego named Encinitas
California. Encinitas is a surfer's town that sits right on the coast and hosts a number of
beautiful beaches, shops, and people. It’s heaven on Earth to me.

<h3>
My favorite adventures
</h3>
<p>
Over the years I’ve been lucky enough to expand my horizons by traveling to new and interesting places. When I came to the University of Maryland from San Diego I didn’t know anyone and I definitely didn't know anything about the culture out here. But I took my lack of experience on the East Coast as a challenge. I’ve been up and down the east coast from New Orleans to New York, the to the mountains of West Virginia to the Outer Banks. I’ve learned what a “jawn” is and how to craft the perfect order at Cookout. I hiked in the Appalachian Mountains and attended Ocean City Maryland concerts. I feel confident in what I’ve been able to take in over the last four years and as a west coaster I feel like I’ve gotten the full monty when It comes to rich adventures.

<h3>
What I’ve been up to and where I’m going
</h3>
<p>
As a journalism major, I have to take plenty of journalism classes so as I’m nearing the end of my college career I’m simply finishing those up. I’m currently studying for the ASTB which stands for the Aviation Selection Test Battery, which is the test that will get me an aviation contract with the Marine Corps. I’m pursuing a career as a Marine Corps pilot and am putting in all the necessary training for that such as running and lifting weights. But for now, my biggest priority is just passing all of my classes so that I can graduate on time and get into the workforce. Besides another semester means more cash I got to shovel out and who wants that am I right?
