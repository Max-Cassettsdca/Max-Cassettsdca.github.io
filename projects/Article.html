    <h3> History Of Kentucky</h3>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Kentucky's rich history spans thousands of years, from prehistoric times when mammoths roamed the Ohio River Valley to its eventual statehood. The region was home to various Native American cultures before European exploration began in the late 17th century. Kentucky's path to statehood was complex, involving multiple conventions and negotiations. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the 15th state in the Union and the first west of the Appalachian Mountains. The state's early economy relied heavily on agriculture, particularly tobacco cultivation, and slave labor. During the Civil War, Kentucky was a border state with divided loyalties, officially remaining in the Union while also having a Confederate shadow government. Throughout its history, Kentucky has played a significant role in American expansion, commerce, and cultural development</p>
