                I’m from a little old town tucked in between Los Angeles and San Diego named Encinitas
                California. Encinitas is a surfer's town that sits right on the coast and hosts a number of
                beautiful beaches, shops, and people. It’s heaven on Earth to me.

            My favorite adventures
        </h3>
        <p>
            Over the years I’ve been lucky enough to expand my horizons by traveling to new and interesting places. When
            I came to the University of Maryland from San Diego I didn’t know anyone and I definitely didn't know
            anything about the culture out here. But I took my lack of experience on the East Coast as a challenge. I’ve
            been up and down the east coast from New Orleans to New York, the to the mountains of West Virginia to the
            Outer Banks. I’ve learned what a “jawn” is and how to craft the perfect order at Cookout. I hiked in the
            Appalachian Mountains and attended Ocean City Maryland concerts. I feel confident in what I’ve been able to
            take in over the last four years and as a west coaster I feel like I’ve gotten the full monty when It comes
            to rich adventures.

                <p>
                    As a journalism major, I have to take plenty of journalism classes so as I’m nearing the end of my
                    college career I’m simply finishing those up. I’m currently studying for the ASTB which stands for
                    the Aviation Selection Test Battery, which is the test that will get me an aviation contract with
                    the Marine Corps. I’m pursuing a career as a Marine Corps pilot and am putting in all the necessary
                    training for that such as running and lifting weights. But for now, my biggest priority is just
                    passing all of my classes so that I can graduate on time and get into the workforce. Besides another
                    semester means more cash I got to shovel out and who wants that am I right?

                        <p>
                            Over the course of the last few years I've been able to go to a few places here and there so
                            I
                            figured I'd regale you with a list of all those destinations.
                        </p>
